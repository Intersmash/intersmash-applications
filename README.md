# Intersmash Applications

Applications used by Intersmash tests.

![Simple build workflow](https://github.com/Intersmash/intersmash-applications/actions/workflows/simple-build.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview 

The goal is to have a common repository for applications that can be built out of community and product bits,
and to be able and compile them by enabling relevant Maven profiles.

The applications are grouped by category, and their POM configuration is designed in a way that allows for them to 
be built either out of community or product bits. 
For example the WildFly applications in the [wildfly](./wildfly) submodule can generate either WildFly or 
JBoss EAP 8.x (8.0.z and 8.1.x)/JBoss EAP XP (5.z and 6.x) applications, see the [wildfly](./wildfly/README.md) module documentation 
for additional details.

The applications can be used by tests and can be built locally or in cloud native environments, e.g.: via the s2i 
process on OpenShift. 

## Modules

### [wildfly](./wildfly)

Applications built for WildFly or JBoss EAP and JBoss EAP XP variants, either via the 
[WildFly Maven Plugin](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin) or the 
[WildFly Jar Maven Plugin](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin).

See the individual applications documentation for more details about the specifics.

### [application-provider](./application-provider)

Provides APIs that allow to access the generated applications.
For instance the 
[ApplicationProvider#wildflyMicroprofileReactiveMessagingKafkaProvisionedServerPath](application-provider/src/main/java/org/jboss/intersmash/applications/ApplicationProvider.java) provides the path of 
the `server` directory which contains a WildFly or JBoss EAP 8.x server generated by the WildFly Maven Plugin, which 
includes the deployment.

### [style-config](./style-config)

Utility module that holds the resources needed to perform code style validation and formatting.
