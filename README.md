# Intersmash Applications

![Simple build workflow](https://github.com/Intersmash/intersmash-applications/actions/workflows/simple-build.yml/badge.svg)

Applications used by Intersmash tests.

## Overview 

The goal is to have a common repository for applications that can be used to test Middleware runtimes interoperability.

The applications are grouped by category, and their POM configuration is designed in a way that allows to build them 
either out of community or product bits. 
For example the WildFly applications in the [wildfly](./wildfly) submodule can generate either WildFly or 
JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP applications, see the [wildfly](./wildfly/README.md) module documentation 
for additional details.

The applications can be built locally or in cloud native environments, e.g.: via the s2i process on OpenShift. 

## Modules

### [wildfly](./wildfly)

Applications built for WildFly or JBoss EAP and JBoss EAP XP variants, either via the 
[WildFly Maven Plugin](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin) or the 
[WildFly Jar Maven Plugin](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin).

See the individual applications documentation for more details about the specifics.

### [application-provider](./application-provider)

Provides APIs that allow to access the generated applications.
For instance the 
[ApplicationProvider#wildflyMicroprofileReactiveMessagingKafkaProvisionedServerPath](application-provider/src/main/java/org/jboss/intersmash/applications/ApplicationProvider.java) provides the path of 
the `server` directory which contains a WildFly or JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP server generated by the WildFly Maven Plugin, 
which includes the deployment.

### [style-config](./style-config)

Utility module that holds the resources needed to perform code style validation and formatting.
